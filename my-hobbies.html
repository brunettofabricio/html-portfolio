    <p>Below you will see a list of things I like to do in my free time:</p>
    <ul>

      <p>I have played since I was 12. My favorite music genre is rock and its variations, especially heavy metal.<br />
      Before moving to the UK I used to have a band in Brazil. If you're into the metal genre, checkout one of our songs:
